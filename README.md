# E-commerce Deployment with Kubernetes: A Hands-on Project ðŸš€

## Introduction 

Launching an e-commerce website is an exciting endeavor, but ensuring it can handle the demands of the modern web is no small feat.  Imagine your website going viral (wouldn't that be amazing?!).  How would you handle the surge in traffic? How can you update your application without interrupting your users' shopping spree?  

These are some of the challenges that containerization and Kubernetes (K8s) are designed to solve.

### The Challenges of Modern Web Deployment

- **Scalability:**  Your application needs to adapt to varying traffic levels, from a trickle of visitors to a flood of eager shoppers. 
- **Consistency:** You need your application to run smoothly and reliably across different environments (development, testing, production) without compatibility issues.
- **Availability:**  Updates and maintenance should be seamless, with zero downtime, so your customers can shop uninterrupted. 

### Containerization and Kubernetes to the Rescue!

**Docker** is our containerization hero, packaging our application and its dependencies into a portable unit that runs consistently anywhere.  Think of it as a self-contained capsule for your code!

**Kubernetes** acts as the conductor, orchestrating the deployment, scaling, and management of our containerized application.  Here's how it tackles our challenges:

- **Dynamic Scaling:** Kubernetes automatically adjusts resources based on real-time demand.  More traffic? No problem, Kubernetes spins up more instances of your application to handle the load!
- **Self-Healing:**  If a container crashes, Kubernetes automatically restarts it on a healthy node, ensuring continuous availability.
- **Seamless Updates & Rollbacks:**  Kubernetes allows you to deploy updates gradually, with zero downtime. And if something goes wrong, rolling back to a previous version is quick and easy. 

### Why This Project Matters

This project will guide you through deploying a real-world e-commerce application using Docker and Kubernetes. You'll gain practical experience with:

- **Containerizing an application with Docker**
- **Deploying and managing applications on Kubernetes**
- **Implementing scalability and self-healing**
- **Performing seamless updates and rollbacks**

By the end, you'll have a solid foundation in modern DevOps practices and the confidence to deploy and manage your applications like a pro!

lets say you starting this afresh

#### create a new directory for your kubernetes project and change directory into it

```bash
mkdir k8s-app-project
cd k8s-app-project
```
#### create the app directory, which would house all the source code and files for the app and change directory into it

```bash
mkdir app
cd app
```
Get all your code files into this folder copy all the code files into this folder

#### Create a Dockerfile

Now, Create a Dockerfile that instructs Docker to: 

* Use php:7.4-apache as the base image.
* Install mysqli extension for PHP.
* Copy the application source code to /var/www/html/.
* Update database connection strings to point to a Kubernetes service named mysql-service.
* Expose port 80 to allow traffic to the web server.

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

Put this in your Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM php:7.4-apache

RUN docker-php-ext-install mysqli

COPY . /var/www/html/

ENV DB_HOST=mysql-service \
    DB_USER=ecomuser \
    DB_PASSWORD=ecompassword \
    DB_NAME=ecomdb

RUN echo "ServerName localhost" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

# Add this line for debugging
RUN echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php

EXPOSE 80

# Add this to print environment variables when the container starts
## CMD echo "DB_HOST: $DB_HOST" && \
    ## echo "DB_USER: $DB_USER" && \
    # echo "DB_PASSWORD: $DB_PASSWORD" && \
    # echo "DB_NAME: $DB_NAME" && \
    # apache2-foreground
```

You now have a dockerfile ready to be built into a docker image.

#### Build and Push the docker Image to docker hub

**Build the Docker image from the directory containing the Dockerfile:**

   ```
   docker build -t cloudikeme/ecom-web:v0.1 .
   ```

**You can then run the container locally for testing:**

   `docker run -p 8080:80 cloudikeme/ecom-web:v0.1`

   This will map port 8080 on your host to port 80 in the container.

**Push it to Docker Hub with :**

`docker push cloudikeme/ecom-web:v0.1`

Outcome: Your web application Docker image is now available on Docker Hub.

### 03

#### Setup KinD Cluster

**Create a single node Kubernetes cluster using KinD**

```bash
kind create cluster --name=web-app-project
```

confirm your node and cluster is running:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

#### Deploy Website to Kubernetes

Create directory 'manifests'

```bash
mkdir manifests
cd manifests
```

Create first manifest : website_deployment.yaml

Since we having 

```bash
touch website-deployment.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ecommerce-website
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ecommerce-website
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ecommerce-website
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ecommerce-website
        image: cloudikeme/ecom-web:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: DB_HOST
          value: mysql-service
        - name: DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secrets
              key: username
        - name: DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secrets
              key: password
        - name: DB_NAME
          value: ecommerce_db
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ecommerce-website-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: ecommerce-website
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

#### create mysql-secrets config and deploy it

kubectl create secret generic mysql-secrets \
  --from-literal=ecomuser=admin \
  --from-literal=ecompassword=admin

#### Deploy websites_deplooyment.yaml
  
  kubectl apply -f manifests/website_deployment.yaml

  kubectl get pods (Verify they are running)

#### Deploy Service

kubectl apply -f manifests/website-service.yaml

Confirm its service is running

kubectl get svc

#### Expose to loadbalancer, using MetalLB

**1. Create the MetalLB namespace:**

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.12.1/manifests/namespace.yaml

**2. Apply the MetalLB manifest:**

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.12.1/manifests/metallb.yaml

**3. Wait for the pods to have a status of Running:**

kubectl get pods -n metallb-system --watch

**4. Configure metallb to use an IP range from the network Docker has created for the kind namespace, we can find this using the following command:**

docker network inspect -f '{{.IPAM.Config}}' kind

**5. The output will include a cidr such as 172.18.0.0/16, so you want your load-balancer services to be assigned an external IP address from this range, for example, to use 172.18.255.200 to 172.19.255.250:**

create a metallb-configmap.yaml file with the following contents (update the IP addresses to be within the range outputted by the previous command):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: config
data:
  config: |
    address-pools:
    - name: default
      protocol: layer2
      addresses:
      - 172.19.255.200-172.19.255.250
```

**6. Add this to your cluster:**

kubectl apply -f manifests/metallb-configmap.yaml

Now when you get your services you should see the foo-bar-service has an external IP:

kubectl get svc

### Add Ingress for WSL and Mac

**1. Update the kind-config.yaml file to allow ingress on ports 80 and 443, and set up a custom node label to identify the control plane node as being ingress-ready:**

Three node cluster with an ingress-ready control-plane node and extra port mappings over 80/443 and 2 workers

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  kubeadmConfigPatches:
  - |
    kind: InitConfiguration
    nodeRegistration:
      kubeletExtraArgs:
        node-labels: "ingress-ready=true"
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 80
    hostPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
  - containerPort: 443
    hostPort: 443
    protocol: TCP
- role: worker
- role: worker
```

Create your cluster with `kind create cluster --config kind-config.yaml`

**2. Patch kind to forward the hostPorts to an NGINX ingress controller and schedule it to the control-plane custom labelled node:**

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/kind/deploy.yaml`

**3. Create an nginx-ingress.yaml file with the following contents:**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/foo"
        backend:
          service:
            name: foo-service
            port:
              number: 80
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/bar"
        backend:
          service:
            name: bar-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

**4. And add this to your cluster (if you get an error you may need to wait a minute or two for the pods in the ingress-nginx namespace to be ready before retrying):**

`kubectl apply -f nginx-ingress.yaml`

This will receive ingress from the host on ports 80 and 443, forward it to the Ingress controller which will use the path to route the request to the appropriate services.

**5. Edit the nginx-ingress.yaml file to have the following contents (note that we're adding an annotation to the metadata as well as updating the two path sections to include a regex):**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/foo(/|$)(.*)"
        backend:
          service:
            name: foo-service
            port:
              number: 80
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/bar(/|$)(.*)"
        backend:
          service:
            name: bar-service
            port:
              number: 80
```
